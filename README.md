# Examples of System Design Excercises

**Please give this repo a star if you find the content valuable, so others can find it too.**

Each example comes with a fully functional sandbox focusing on the most interesting parts. You either need Docker or minikube installed to run the sandboxes. 

Aditionally, I included a README file that contains the key functional/non-functional requirements and explaining the solution in depth. They also include some key findings from the sandbox implementation.
